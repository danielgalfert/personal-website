  <h1 class="h1">Writing</h1>

  <p class="lead">
    Short technical writing on how I approach systems, data, and modeling problems.
    I use writing primarily as a tool for clarity: to make assumptions explicit and
    reasoning inspectable.

  <div class="grid cols-2 gap">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-title">Reproducibility as an engineering constraint</div>
      <div class="card-text">
        Why reproducibility is not a “nice to have” in analytical systems, and how small
        engineering decisions compound into long-term reliability or technical debt.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-title">Validation beyond metrics</div>
      <div class="card-text">
        A discussion of evaluation discipline: what metrics can and cannot tell you,
        how to reason about uncertainty, and when apparent improvements are misleading.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-title">Bridging research code and production systems</div>
      <div class="card-text">
        Lessons learned from turning exploratory or research-oriented code into systems
        that can be deployed, monitored, and handed over to others.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-title">Designing for constrained environments</div>
      <div class="card-text">
        How limitations—compute, data quality, latency, organizational constraints—shape
        better system design when taken seriously from the start.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="margin-top:24px;">
    <div class="card-text">
      Longer or more detailed pieces will be added selectively. I prefer fewer,
      higher-quality explanations over frequent updates.
